    <h1>A Landing Page</h1>
    <p>What Is a Landing Page?<br>
		Diagram of a landing page
		In digital marketing, a landing page is a standalone web page, created specifically for a marketing or advertising campaign. It’s where a visitor “lands” after they click on a link in an email, or ads from Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places on the web.
		
		Unlike web pages, which typically have many goals and encourage exploration, landing pages are designed with a single focus or goal, known as a call to action (or CTA, for short).
		
		It’s this focus that makes landing pages the best option for increasing the conversion rates of your marketing campaigns and lowering your cost of acquiring a lead or sale.</p>

		<h1>Why a Landing Page is Necesarry</h1>
		<p>What is the purpose of a landing page?<br>
			A landing page aims to capture information from contacts in exchange for something of value, such as a retail offer code or business-to-business (B2B) insights in the form of a white paper. Landing pages are different from other web pages in that they don't live in the evergreen navigation of a website. <br>

<p><h2>The 2 main types of landing pages</h2>
	<h3>
	As far as structure goes, landing pages are generally built to serve 1 of 2 functions: generate leads or direct users to the next step.<br>
	
	Lead generation landing pages
	Also known as “lead gen” and “lead capture” pages, this type of landing page focuses on collecting lead data. In other words, it collects information about your customers.<br>
	
	The trademark feature of a lead capture page is a form, which serves as the CTA. In exchange for a product or service, it asks users for data like their names, email addresses, and phone numbers. You can even ask for more specific details like their age ranges or job titles. That way you can contact leads and nurture their interest in your business.<br>
	
	This data serves another purpose as well. The information you collect can teach you about your contacts. You can then focus your marketing efforts and target the people who match them and are consequently more likely to convert. This can increase your return on investment (ROI), especially if you run paid advertising campaigns.<br>
	
	In this way, the data that lead generation pages capture helps improve your marketing strategy and make it more efficient. It allows you to tailor your ads to your audience so that you won’t spend money advertising to people who aren’t likely to convert.<br>
	
	Lead-generation landing pages are a valuable asset to your business because they provide insight on who your potential customers are as well as how you can reach them. If lead nurturing is a priority for you—or you need to understand your audience better—consider adding one to your site.<br></h3></p>
	
	<h3>Click-through landing pages
		Unlike lead gen pages, which use forms, the focal points of click-through landing pages are CTA buttons. Clicking the button redirects your users to a page where they can complete your desired action.<br>
		
		For example, a button that says "schedule a demo" might take the user to a scheduling page, “order X now" would redirect to a checkout page, and so on.<br>
		
		You’ll often find click-through landing pages on e-commerce websites or other sites that are more focused on making sales immediately rather than collecting user information. Besides the CTA button, these landing pages generally include persuasive information like product details or user testimonials to further intrigue and engage prospective customers.
